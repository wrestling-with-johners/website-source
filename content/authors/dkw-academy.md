DKW has a rich history of being one of the longest running training schools in the entire UK, producing the likes of current SmackDown superstar Elton Prince, current SmackDown General Manager, Nick Aldis and current WWE Commentator and former Intercontinental and Tag Team Champion, Wade Barrett.

Started in 1998, DKW has recently celebrated its 25th Anniversary. The academy is at the forefront of everything they do, and their live shows are great fun for all the family.
