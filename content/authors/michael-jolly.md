I’ve been a huge wrestling fan since the mid 80s with ITV’s The World of Sport then thanks to Sky TV I was introduced to WWF/WWE & WCW. Now in my 40s I’m loving what is now available to watch from around the world.

I’ve had the privilege to watch some fantastic British Wrestling over the past 10 years which has led to me working with some incredible wrestlers as well as dabbling in commentary, being a backstage runner & writing the shows.

In 2020 I was invited onto the WWJP as we talked NXT & Drew McIntyre’s first run as the WWE Champion which then led to me meeting a great group of people to create The Turnbuckle Arms Podcast.

If you’re a fan of the British Wrestling scene then I’m here to let you what’s going on, whether that be which companies to checkout and where to watch them.
