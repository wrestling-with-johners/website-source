The Wrestling Outsider Team offer a ringside perspective - sometimes insightful, often quirky but always passionate; Claire, Dan and Hicksy preview and review UK wrestling events which they attend in the Beds and Herts area (and beyond).
Also showcasing British talent, both established and up and coming, with promos and interviews, we encourage you to:
"STAY IN THE KNOW WITH THE W.O.!"
