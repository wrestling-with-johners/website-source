I've been a massive fan of Professional Wrestling since the early 90's. However I remember watching British Wrestling on ITV's The World of Sports with my Nan, every Saturday afternoon in the mid to late 80's.

If I were to be put on the spot I would have to say that Ric Flair and Daniel Bryan are my favourite wrestlers ever. I was inspired to start the Wrestling With Johners Podcast after my trip to WrestleMania 34 in New Orleans, with the first episode going out in November 2018.

One year later I was inspired to launch the WWJ website, allowing me to bring together all of my social media and podcasting activities into one space. I hope you enjoy the many great articles and podcast episodes available right here, and so much more!
