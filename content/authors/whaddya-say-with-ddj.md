Whaddya Say With DDJ is a long form interview style show where I interview pro wrestlers and those associated with pro wrestling. Most of my interviews are with those who wrestle in the Chicagoland area. Former guests include John Bullard, Tim Storm, C Red, Paragon, amongst others.

I’ve been a pro wrestling fan for over 30 years. My all time favorites include: Ric Flair, Ricky Steamboat, Randy Savage, Steve Austin, and Kurt Angle. Currently I’m a fan of: Cody Rhodes, Kenny Omega, AJ Styles, Cameron Grimes and Eddie Edwards.
