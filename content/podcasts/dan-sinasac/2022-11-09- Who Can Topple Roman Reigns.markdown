# Who  Can Topple Roman Reigns?

Roman Reigns is approaching god-like status in WWE. He has held both World Championships for the better part of this year, and has carried the Universal strap for over two years! Add to that the fact that the last time he was pinned was in 2019 and he has cemented himself as the top dog in the world of wrestling. 

With all of the opponents, Reigns has run through the championship contenders pool is running shallow.  At what point does WWE start thinking about taking the titles off Reigns? We can assume that Logan Paul will get squashed at Crown Jewel, so who else has a shot? Which men have the best chance of dethroning the champ? Let’s take a look at a few possibilities below.

## Cody Rhodes

Rhodes has been one of the best stories of 2022. His triumphant return, followed by a fantastic feud with Seth Rollins, put him at the top of the wrestling world. 

The rumours of his Money in the Bank win ran rampant over the internet before he went down with an injury. It was thought that he would use this to get the strap from Reigns, but there may be a bigger story at play here. 

Rhodes was incredibly over and him making his return to win the Royal Rumble and main-eventing Wrestlemania would be a great story. It could be made even better by having him upend Reigns for the World Championship. 

## Drew McIntyre

Drew never got his time in the sun. Sure, he won the WWE Championship and carried through the pandemic, but he never got to have his reign in front of fans. 

Since fans returned Drew has done nothing but crush it every right. He is one of the most popular wrestlers on the roster, and will always be a legitimate threat to a world championship. 

Also, he gave Reigns all he could handle at Clash at the Castle. If it was not for Sikoa Drew would have won the match, so a redemption story would be an easy one to write. 

## The Rock

This has been the dream match that everyone has been talking about for some time. The family members have been tied together for years and with Wrestlemania being in Los Angeles, the rumour mill has been ramping up. 

The Rock is not close to being a full-time competitor but it would shock no one to see him get one over Reigns. WWE has long had a habit of putting a world title on a part-time star, and it could very well be the reason that they coax the Great One back to the show. 

## Gunther

This one would happen much further down the road than others, but it wouldn’t be the worst of ideas. Since joining the main roster, Gunther has been fantastic. Alongside Imperium he has developed a great heel character that could flourish at the top of the card. 

Gunther is a heel but stranger things have happened before. He and Reigns could have some great matches with each other, and a feud that could involve some great multi-man matches between Imperium and The Bloodline. 

## Bray Wyatt

The return of Bray Wyatt has been a great thing for the wrestling world. He is a great character and one that has the audience behind him. For right now he seems to be working opposite this Uncle Howdy character, but what about after?

If WWE keeps the momentum of Wyatt going it would make sense to have him go after Reigns. They have some history there and their matches have been great physical contests. Also, it would be a great redemption arc for Wyatt to get the World Championship back on his shoulders.
