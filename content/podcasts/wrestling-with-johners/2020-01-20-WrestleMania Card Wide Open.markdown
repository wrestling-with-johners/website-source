It is being reported from sources within WWE that WrestleMania 36 is still "wide open in many regards."

At this point in previous years, there would be run-sheets or tentative WrestleMania lineups around, though those have been made more secretive in recent years. According to Sean Ross Sapp from Fightful.com, no one he's spoken to has seen a run sheet or anything related to WrestleMania 36 yet. 

There have even been a couple of people at the WWE Performance Center who have been told to "be ready" in case a WrestleMania spot is there for them.

This could be seen as a massive positive and a welcome change, as compared to previous years. One wrestler spoken to said that it leads them to think WWE will go with who is hot for certain spots, instead of trying to make certain talents hot to fit the roles they've already decided for them.

WrestleMania 36 is more than 2 months away, but there is already speculation regarding potential match-ups and whether NXT talent could be a part of the "Showcase of the Immortals" on April 5th in Tampa, Florida.
