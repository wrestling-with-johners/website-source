There were no details provided on why he will be appearing on the show, but it could be related to WrestleMania. Cena has indicated that he would like to have a role in this year's WrestleMania. However in a recent tweet Cena has stated that he will be on Smackdown to promote his latsest movie 'The Invisible Man'.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/WWE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WWE</a> for allowing me the opportunity to come to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Smackdown?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Smackdown</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/WWEonFOX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WWEonFOX</a> to promote a project nearly 20 years in the making. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InvisibleMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#InvisibleMan</a> üñêüòÅ <a href="https://t.co/vN3FcK8RN2">https://t.co/vN3FcK8RN2</a> <a href="https://t.co/OWqhxUPyB6">pic.twitter.com/OWqhxUPyB6</a></p>&mdash; John Cena (@JohnCena) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCena/status/1227569624868425729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It is believed that Cena has been booked to appear on Smackdown on February 28 not only to promote his movie, but also to set up a possible match for WrestleMania. Please note that that this episode of Smackdown will air the night following Super-Showdown, from Saudi Arabia. With Cena potentially being lined up as a big name back-up, in case there are any 'Flight Delays' similar to the WWE's last visit to Saudi Arabia, in October 2019.
