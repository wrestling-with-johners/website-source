When I first started to enjoy professional wrestling in late 1991/early 1992, in a pre-internet era, I would search far and wide for every wrestling magazine title available in the UK during that period of time. I would read every magazine from cover to cover. From The Ring, to Pro Wrestling Illustrated, the WWF magazine and WCW magazine, to name but a few. But the one magazine that stood head and shoulders above all the others was a certain wrestling magazine, called Superstars of Wrestling. 

S.O.W was a UK based wrestling magazine, written and edited by Findlay Martin. Superstars of Wrestling was the only magazine that took an objective view on pro wrestling, with a forthright writing style that gave us fans an honest peek behind the curtain of our beloved and favourite form of (sports) entertainment – Professional Wrestling.

After a couple of years, Superstars of Wrestling transitioned into being Power Slam magazine (1994) and became my monthly go-to wrestling magazine for another 20 years, until its demise in 2014. Besides being the best wrestling magazine on the shelves of W.H.Smith for over 20 years, it also gave us wrestling fans a fantastic range of articles and regular features that held my interest and had me genuinely excited for each new edition. One of those features was their annual Power Slam End of Year reader’s awards. I would spend hours fulling out my nominations for all of the categories on offer, and it would be an exciting opportunity to add my “expert” views on all that had gone down in the world of Pro Wrestling, from the previous 12 months.

So, in honour of Power Slam’s End of Year Awards, I decided to do something similar, in the lead up to our End of Year Awards podcast special on 21st December 2019. By offering the listeners of the WWJ Pod an opportunity to vote on who they believe should be the deserved winners of our very own annual Pro Wrestling awards. And with 2019 being the last year from the 2010’s decade, there are also a few ‘End of Decade Awards’ up for grabs in amongst this year’s awards.

Remember, all of the winners and all of those nominated were voted for by the listeners of the Wrestling With Johners podcast. So, thanks to everyone who took the time to cast their votes. 

Enjoy the full run-down of nominees and winners to all 25 categories below!
