Well here we go! We are live and time to make review history. First match is…

## Trent Seven vs. Eddie Dennis
 
Very, very good match to start things out. The crowd are absolutely hot. Hard hitting action. Eddie threw Trent over the top rope for the high spot.  By the way I have a great view of the ring. I did enjoy this match. My prediction came true. 

Winner of the match Eddie Dennis.

## Kay Lee Ray vs Piper Niven vs Toni Storm in a triple threat match for the NXT UK women’s title. 

What a match. Just incredible! All 3 women left it all in the ring. High spots and high flying action. The crowd were super-hot. I'm lost for words. Toni hit her  finisher and was so close to winning the title but it didn't happen. So many pin fall attempts, by all 3 women. The title did not change hands.

Winner of the match and still NXT UK Women’s champion: Kay Lee 

## Tyler Bate vs Jordan Devlin 

Wow, wow, wow! What an incredible match. We get an “Are you watching Vince McMahon chant. Another great match. During this match I discovered the commentators are on the balcony above me. I got the prediction wrong for this one.

Yet another incredible match. All tag teams in the hunt for the titles. High flying action. Tag Gold on the line. A really hot crowd. This is wrestling! The titles didn't change hands. 

Winner of the match and still NXT UK tag team champions, Gallus.

Review time for the main event 

## Walter vs. Joe Coffey for the WWE UK title.

Wow, just wow! What a match. What a main event. Hard hitting powerful action. I thought this was never going to end. Both men with big moves. The referee got knocked down during the match by Walter, so in comes Alexander Wolfe to help him. Here comes Ilja Dragunov to take out Wolfe, the match continues and didn't end there. This was breath taking. I'm so happy I got to witness it live.

The finish came out of nowhere. A sleeper hold. Yes a sleeper bold from Walter. But wait a minute they are here. It's the Undisputed Era bay-bay. 

They destroy Imperium. Winner of the match and still WWE UK Champion, Walter.
