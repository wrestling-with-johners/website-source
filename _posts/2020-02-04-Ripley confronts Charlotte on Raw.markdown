On last night's Monday Night RAW Charlotte Flair conducted an in-ring promo to address which championship she will be challenging for as the Royal Rumble winner, at WrestleMania 36 on 5th April.

Charlotte announced that "She has held the RAW Women's championship multiple times and has beaten Becky" and that "She's held the Smackdown Women's champion multiple times and has beaten Bailey".

As the fans in the arena started to chant NXT, Charlotte said that "The Queen has love for NXT and NXT has love for the Queen".

Current NXT Women's champion Ripley came out to address Charlotte. Ripley told Charlotte "That The Queen has already beaten Becky and Bailey. But she has not beaten her". Ripley continued by saying that she has however beaten the Queen, as Charlotte walked out of the ring, with Ripley holding her NXT gold above her head.

Later in the evening it was announced that Charlotte will be on NXT this Wednesday on the USA Network, to address Rhea Ripley's challenge and to announce which title she will be challenging for at WrestleMania 36.

As the storyline would suggest it looks certain that the Women's NXT Championship will be defended at WrestleMania, with Charlotte going up against current NXT Women's champion Rhea Ripley.

Let's not forget that Ripley will be defending her NXT Championship on 16th February at NXT Takeover Portland against current No.1 contender Bianca Belair. 

We could also see Charlotte make a cameo apperence during the Ripley vs. Belair match in Portland, further setting up their match for Mania 36.

And with Belair's very strong showing at this year's Royal Rumble I wouldn't be surprised to see Belair featured in a WrestleMania match as well. With the possibility of the NXT Women's championship match becoming a Triple-Threat match between all three.
