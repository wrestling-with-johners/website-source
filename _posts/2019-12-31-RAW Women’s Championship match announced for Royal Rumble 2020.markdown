It was announced on the Dec 30th edition of RAW that Becky Lynch will face Asuka, at the Royal Rumble PPV from Houston, Texas on 26th Jan. With Becky’s RAW Women’s Championship on the line.

In a backstage segment Becky told Charly Caruso that this was the match she wanted during recent contract negotiations. With Asuka being the only WWE Superstar on the women’s roster that she is yet to defeat. ‘The Man’ is looking for redemption after losing to Asuka at last year’s Royal Rumble, tapping out to the ‘Asuka-lock’.

Lynch looks to continue her reign as the longest reigning RAW Women’s Champion, which started at WrestleMania 35. But don’t rule out the current Women’s Tag Team Champion Asuka, as she looks to become “Asuka two-belts” on 26th Jan 2020.
