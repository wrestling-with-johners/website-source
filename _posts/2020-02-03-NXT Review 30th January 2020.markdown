Good match. I do think Danny should be just NXT UK from now on. This was a fresh match. I do like fresh matches. The Hunt really need that big win, but they didn't get it here. An assited DDT by Burch and Lorcan for the win.

** WINNER OF THE MATCH: ONEY LORCAN AND DANNY BURCH 

Eddie Dennis comes out to cut a promo. Trent Seven interrupts him wanting a rematch and wants it to be a street fight. Eddie and Trent brawl to end this segment.

** NINA SAMUELS Vs. ISLA DAWN

Ok match here, even though it was a rematch. Isla was in control for most of the match. She seems to have got alot better. Isla goes over.

** TYSON T-BONE Vs. RIDGE HOLLAND

This was a scrap. A brawl. Hard hitting action. Both men laying in the punches. I liked T-Bone's attitude here, he needs to show more of it. He also needs a big win, but didn't get it here. Ridge Holland wins.

Tonight's Main Event.

** IMPERIUM Vs. DAVE MASTIFF, MARK ANDREWS AND FLASH MORGAN WEBSTER
