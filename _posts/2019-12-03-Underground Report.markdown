Colt has been at AAW since the start but he has never had the privilege of representing AAW as champion, he has held the AAW Heritage title but never the AAW Heavyweight title, Colt says he knows Josh wants the Colt Cobana of old and Colt will bring out his serious side and Josh is going to regret ever asking for it.

Jimmy Jacobs comes to the ring dressed in evening clothes and cuts a promo saying he has to take control of the Mance Warner situation.
