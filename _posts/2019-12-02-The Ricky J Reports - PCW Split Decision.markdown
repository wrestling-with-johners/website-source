Another alright match.  AC in control for most of the match.  AC has gone from number one contender to facing mark Alexander price.  A surprising win in this one.  Winner of the match Mark Alexander Price. Time for another match.  

## PARADOX VS DEVASTATING DAN WHYTE AND RYAN LLOYD 
Ryan was actually alright.  I believe this was Andy Knoxs evogue debut.  Ok tag match.  I do like paradox they are good. Winner of the match Paradox Next match on its way.  
CJ BANKS VS SERBIUS CJ getting heat before the match with a heel promo.  Serbius has got alot better.  I was impressed by him.  Good back and fourth action.  Typical heel vs face match.  Winner of the match CJ Banks. It's now white collar wrestling.  And the match is.....

## JOEY HAYES VS EREBUS

## ROSSY RASCAL VS WARD THE BUTCHER 
I was impressed by the butcher.  Good gimmick  Good back and fourth action.  I liked this one.  Winner of the match Rossy Rascal Next match 

## JOEY HAYES VS DANNY HOPE VS BIG T JUSTICE IN A TRIPLE THREAT MATCH FOR THE PCW CHAMPIONSHIP 
Good triple threat match.  Danny and Big T beat up Joey.  I thought this would have been the main event but I guess not.  I was expecting a new champion here.  Winner of the match and still PCW champion Joey Hayes Next match is women's action.  

## LIZZY STYLES VS LAURA ROSE FOR THR PCW WOMENS TITLE
Laura was alright.  Lizzy is a good heel.  Good to see a women's match.  Laura impressed me.  She came close to winning the title.  Winner of the match and still PCW women's champion Lizzy styles NOW ITS THE MAIN EVENT.  

## CJ BANKS AND DANNY HOPE VS PL DOTSON AND LORDY 
I was surprised this way the main event.  Dotson was super over.  He was good Lordy was ok.  CJ is very good at getting heat.  Typical tag team match Winners of the match PL Dotson and Lordy It was an alright show and i give It 5 out 10.

Unfortunately I feel this is the beginning of the end for PCW.  Only 50 people in attendance.
