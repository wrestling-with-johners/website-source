First match of 2020 - Dave Mastiff vs Kona Reeves. 

Kona cut a promo before the match to get heat. This was an ok match. Kona hasn't been too lucky since coming to NXT UK. 

Winner of the match: Dave Mastiff.

Here comes Toni Storm. She calls out Piper Niven she asks Piper to step aside. Piper says no. They brawl and out comes Kay Lee Ray.

Kassius Ohno vs Ligero.

Good match. I enjoyed this one. Kassius is a good heel. He is getting a push on NXT UK more than the normal NXT. Not many High flying moves in this match. Kassius Ohno cuts a promo after the match. 

Winner of the match: Kassius Ohno.

Ashton Smith and Oliver Carter vs The Outliers: Riddick Moss and Dorian Mack.

Good tag match. Ashton and Oliver have had no luck and no wins since coming to NXT UK. Hopefully the team of Riddick Moss & Dorian Mack are going to get a push. A very shocking end to the match. 

Winner of the match: Ashton Smith and Oliver Carter.

Alexander Wolfe vs Ilja Dragunov in a No DQ Match.

Good main event. Many weapons involved. Great story telling in this one. The rest of imperium banned from ringside. Ilja went after Alexander before the bell. Brutal match. DDT and a suplex onto chairs. A chair uses on Iljaâ€™s fingers. 

Winner of the match: Ilja Dragunov. Really good way to start off 2020.
