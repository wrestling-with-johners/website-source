## WWE NXT UK Review - February 20th 2020

## TYLER BATE Vs. JOSEPH CONNORS

Fresh match here. I always like fresh matches. Good match. Many pinfall attempts. In my opinion the wrong person won here.

I don't think there's much left for Bate to do in NXTUK. He doesn't need the win more than Commers does at the moment.

## NOAM DAR Vs. JOSH MORRELL

Back and fourth action here. It was an Ok match. Morrell really needs a big win.

He hasn't won a match yet on NXTUK. It was no different here.

Tonight's main event.

## JOE COFFEY Vs. ILJA DRAGUNOV 

Only 3 matches on this episode. This episode felt shorter than others. Good match here. Hard hitting action. I'm not too sure who was the heel and who was the face here in this match.

I would say a much needed win for ilja here.

I give it 6 and a half out of 10.
