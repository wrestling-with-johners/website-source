## WWE NXT UK Review - March 5th 2020

Well here we are, the first review of March and let's get to the first match.

## TRAVIS BANKS Vs. ALEXANDER WOLFE

Travis went right after Wolfe straight out the gate. Very good opening match here!

Good back and fourth action. This went longer than I thought it would. I still think Travis needs that big win. 

No luck tonight though. Wolfe with the powerbomb for the victory.

## RIDGE HOLLAND VS. SAXON HUXLEY

Saxon tried to get the jump start on Ridge, but to no effect.

This was mostly a squash match. Ridge was dominant here and continues his winning streak.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: RIDGE HOLLAND** 

## ISLA DAWN Vs. AOIFE VALKARYIE 

Good match. Aoife continues to impress me. She's got a good gimmick.

She looked better in this one. Isla has improved also but she couldn't get it done here. 

A top rope split kick from Aoife for the win!

## MAIN EVENT TIME 

## WALTER Vs. DAVE MASTIFF (NXT UK CHAMPIONSHIP)

Hot crowd for this match. I would have had this match at TakeOver Dublin, but ah well.

Two big guys and hard hitting action. Walter went for the powerbomb twice, but to no avail. 

![walter1](/assets/posts/2020-03-07/walter1.jpg){:class="restrict-width"}

I really enjoyed this match. Walter eventually hit the powerbomb for the win. Mastiff looked good in defeat in my opinion.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH AND STILL NXT UK CHAMPION: WALTER** 

I give it 7 and a half out of 10. Once again a good episode.
