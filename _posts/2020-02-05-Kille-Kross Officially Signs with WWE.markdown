Thatcher is well-known for wrestling on the Indy circuit around the States and Europe, and is also renowned for being a former stable-mate of Walter and Marcel Barthell, as part of Ring Kampf in wXw in Germany. Similar to Kross, it is expected that Thatcher will join the Black & Gold brand within the next few weeks.

Expect new ring names for both wrestlers when they both officially make their TV debuts.
