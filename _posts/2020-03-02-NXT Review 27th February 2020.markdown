## WWE NXT UK Review - February 27th 2020

Well, first of all it's been along day, with Super ShowDown earlier. Eurgh, it was somewhat of a let-down!

## THE GRIZZLED YOUNG VETERANS Vs. THE 

Good match to start the night. Hard hitting action here. The Hunt really needs that big win.

Also, I have said this about other people, but the Grizzled Young Veterans need to be on just one brand. 

The Hunt lost another match.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: THE GRIZZLED YOUNG VETERANS** 

## KASSIUS OHNO Vs. JACK STARZ

This was an ok match. Jack actually had some offense here. This was probably his best match yet on the NXT UK brand. 

Ohno dominated him though and picked up the win.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: KASSIUS OHNO**

## A-KID Vs. THE BRIAN KENDRICK 

The Brian Kendrick on NXT UK once again. Good match here. Lots of high flying moves from A-Kid.

Kendrick not having much luck as of late, and it continued here. Kid with the W.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: A-KID**

Tonight's Main Event.

## TONI STORM Vs. KAY LEE RAY (IN AN I QUIT MATCH FOR THE NXT UK WOMEN'S TITLE)

History being made with the first ever 'I Quit' match on NXT UK. Great match! A table got used in the match and even wrist tape. 

Typical I Quit match. KLR taped Toni's hands behind her back and put her hand in a chair.

She then put her neck in a chair and jumped off the top rope down onto the chair. Very brutal!

**WINNER OF THE MATCH AND STILL NXT UK WOMENS CHAMPION: KAY LEE RAY**

Really good show tonight and I give it 7 out of 10.
