## WWE NXT UK Review - March 12th 2020

We have Andy Shepard joining Nigel McGuinness on commentary, this week from Coventry.

Finn Balor comes out to cut a promo. A huge name for NXT UK from the Black & Gold brand.

Out comes Walter with Imperium. Alexander Wolfe cuts a promo.

They go after Balor, but he makes the escape.

## PRETTY DEADLY Vs. DAN MALONEY AND DEREISS GORDON 

An alright opening match. Maloney and Gordon were ok in this match. 

This was pretty much a squash match. 

It looks like a push for Pretty Deadly.

Nigel was putting them over big on commentary. They take the win!

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: PRETTY DEADLY**

## NOAM DAR Vs. LIGERO 

Really good match. I really enjoyed this one.

Dar keeps getting better and better. Hard hitting action. Both men with great offense. 

Ligero needs that big win but didn't get it here. Dar goes over!

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: NOAM DAR** 

## DANI LUNA Vs. AMALE 

This match was ok, but didn't last long.

Kay Lee Ray got involved, giving Dani Luna the win by DQ. KLR then cut a promo.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH BY DQ: DANI LUNA** 

## FINN BALOR Vs. ALEXANDER WOLFE

Balor in action on NXT UK is huge! Something I never thought I would see. 

![balor3](/assets/posts/2020-03-15/balor3.jpg){:class="restrict-width"}

Really good main event. Imperium came out to try and help Wolfe, but the referee sent them to the back. 

![imperium2](/assets/posts/2020-03-15/imperium2.jpg){:class="restrict-width"}

Back and fourth action from both men. I guess this make Balor a babyface?

![wolfe](/assets/posts/2020-03-15/wolfe.jpg){:class="restrict-width"}

I also reckon we are going to see Walter vs Balor at TakeOver Dublin.

Crowd was hot for this. Balor is your winner.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: FINN BALOR** 

Really good episode and I give it 8 out of 10.
