## PIPER NIVEN Vs. DANI LUNA

Ok match to start. Piper really needs to build up those wins again. Not to much else to be said here. Dani unsuccessful on this occasion.

This is a match between Mentor vs Student in this one. Good match. Great back and fourth action. Kid gave Tyler his all unfortunately he seems to have become a more of an Enhancement talent. But it is early days for A-Kid.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: TYLER BATE** 
  
After the match Joesph Connors came out and cut a promo on Tyler. Setting up a possible feud between these two.

## PRETTY DEADLY Vs. ASHTON SMITH AND OLIVER CARTER 

Pretty Deadly consist of Sam Stoker and Lewis Howley. I have actually met Stoker at PCW. Both these tag teams need the win. This was a good match here. Pretty Deadly take the loss.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: OLIVER CARTER AND ASHTON SMITH**

Out comes Kay Lee Ray to cut a promo. KLR is interupted by Toni Storm. They will have an I quit match for the NXT title at some point soon.

MAIN EVENT....

## EDDIE DENNIS Vs. TRENT SEVEN - IN THE FIRST EVER STEEL CORNERS STREET FIGHT

This is my first time seeing a match like this. NXT UK seem to a have a lot of firsts. Good match right here. They fought everywhere and into the crowd. Steel steps were involved. What a match. They fought to the announce table and Trent puts Eddie through a table. Very brutal. Hard hitting action.

In my opinion the wrong person won.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: TRENT SEVEN**

I give it 8 out of 10.

It was a very good episode of NXT UK this week.
