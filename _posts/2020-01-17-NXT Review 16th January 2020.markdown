We are coming off the heels off NXT:UK Takeover Blackpool 2. Only 2 matches on this week’s episode on the WWE Network. 
First match is...

## A-Kid vs. Joseph Connors

These matches were taped before takeover Blackpool 2. This was a good match. I do think Connors should have been on the main Takeover card. It's cool we got a taping before Takeover. A-kid seems to have turned into a jobber. Connors with the win in this match.

WINNER OF THE MATCH: Joseph Connors.

## Kassius Ohno vs. Dave Mastiff

Another good match here. Hard hitting as expected.

This is another match I enjoyed but I do think the wrong person won, on this occasion. I thought Ohno was being pushed.

WINNER OF THE MATCH: Dave Mastiff. 

This was a good episode of NXT:UK.
