WWE NXT UK Review - February 13th 2020

## AOIFE VALKARYIE Vs. AMALE

Debut time here. My first g;impse of Aoife. She was impressive with some really good moves.

Maybe she will go after the women's UK title at some point. Ok opening match. Amale loses in this opener.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: AOIFE VALKARYIE** 

## DAVE MASTIFF Vs. SAXON HUXLEY

Mastiff dominates most of this match. Huxley getting little offense in. Basically a squash match here but Mastiff wants Walter, and this was his message to the current NXT UK champ.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: DAVE MASTIFF**

Out come the Grizzled Young Veterans. Zack Gibson cuts a good promo explaining how they believe they have been treated unfairly by NXTUK GM Johnny Saint.

## JOE COFFEY Vs. AMIR JORDAN

Again mostly another squash match. A new attitude from Joe Coffey during this match.

Not to much for me to say here. Amir takes the loss in this one.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: JOE COFFEY**

After the match Joe cuts a promo.

Main event.

## GALLUS Vs. ONEY LORCAN AND DANNY BURCH 

Hard hitting match here. Strong style throughout the match. I think the wrong people won here, but it is what it is. Once again a new attitude from Gallus.

**WINNER OF THE MATCH: GALLUS**

After the match Ilja Dragunov came out but got attacked by Gallus.

I give it a 7 out of 10. It was a good episode.
