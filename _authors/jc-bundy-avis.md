I have been into Pro Wrestling since I was 8 years old when my grandparents got sky for the first time. I just remember watching WWE and just being in awe of the Ultimate Warrior. And that was it, I was hooked. I remember staying up to watch what I still think is the greatest of Wrestlemania’s, which to me was 6 and just couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. So from then on I was hooked and tried to catch whatever show I could at the time and my love of Wrestling grew from there.

I am now 37 and still watch wrestling as often as possible although I now prefer watching Indy shows. My favourite promotions now are AAW, Warrior Wrestling, Northeast Wrestling, PCW Ultra and Defy through Highspots Wrestling Network. As far as Mainstream goes I watch NJPW and AEW. I hardly Watch WWE, as to me they have declined in quality over the years.

I hope to keep providing high quality show reports for the Wrestling With Johners page and be a vital and Integral part of the team.
