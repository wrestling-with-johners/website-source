My name is Kyle and I am the host of Kyle's Wrestling channel. I'm a huge fan of Professional Wrestling and love to interview wrestlers and people within the industry.

I also love to watch and review pro wrestling from around the world & you can hear my thoughts on some of my favourite wrestling matches, promotions and shows right here, on the Johners Podcasting Network.
