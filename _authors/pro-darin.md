I hail from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I have been watching pro wrestling since the mid-1990s, and started watching WWE more often in the late 1990s when the "Attitude Era" was still going on. I would then check out indie wrestling shows, as well as shows affiliated with companies such as the National Wrestling Alliance as soon as we stepped foot into the 21st century. When it comes to reading articles, I might throw in some references to shows I've watched in the past (whether it is or isn't from a WWE show). Also since I'm also a fan of NASCAR, music, and nostalgia/pop culture that isn't pro wrestling related, I would even throw in some references Mauro Ranallo-style (i.e.: throwing more shade than a sun visor, someone being dominant like an athlete or team that competed in the same week the shows I watched occurred, etc.).
