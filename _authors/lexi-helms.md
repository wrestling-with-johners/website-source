Lexi Helms has been a wrestling fan for close to 3 decades. It was boredom and the desire to share her opinions that influenced the decision to put her fandom and obsession for wrestling into the articles you read here. She has written for other wrestling websites, including V2 Wrestling. 
Lexi is based in the North West of England, with her heart belonging to the City of Liverpool. Occasionally, she has been known to visit other places. Before writing wrestling-based opinions for internet strangers, she was a Teacher. If you can’t find her doing something wrestling related, you’re more than likely to find her doing one of the following; making to do lists; cleaning; listening to metal; in the kitchen making something; or stabbing fabric repeatedly to make pretty patterns. Don’t be fooled though – there is a high probability she’s also thinking about wrestling. 
For more information about her dull, yet, opinionated life, follow her on social media.
