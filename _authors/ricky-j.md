My name is Richard Pate (Rick The Rock) I have been watching professional wrestling for 19 years. I have also been lucky enough to watch live wrestling from many promotions. Including, WWE, Impact,roh, NJPW, PCW, WCPW and Unstoppable Wrestling. My favourite wrestlers ever is The Rock. It's a great honour for me to be involved with the Wrestling With Johners website. I will be bringing PCW blogs and hopefully much more.
